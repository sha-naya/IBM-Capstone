## Comparing Chinatowns around the world using Foursquare API location data

This repository contains files related to my capstone project for IBM's Applied Data Science specialization using Python
on Coursera.

Using Foursquare API location data, I compared several Chinatown locations across the globe to see which are similar.
Using machine learning k-means clustering algorithm, I divided the locations into 3 clusters based on venue categories.

I initially believed that Chinatowns in the United States are likely to belong in the same cluster. However, the results
suggested that American Chinatowns are in fact very different.

A full written report is available in PDF format, along with the Jupyter Notebook code and other relevant files.
